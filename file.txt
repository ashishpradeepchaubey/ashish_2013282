TXT is a file extension for a text file, used by a variety of text editors. 

Text is a human-readable sequence of characters and the words they form that can be encoded into computer-readable formats. There is no standard definition of a text file, though there are several common formats, including ASCII (a cross-platform format), and ANSI (used on DOS and Windows platforms).
